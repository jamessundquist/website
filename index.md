# Welcome

Hello! I am a Principal Research Scientist at NSI, Inc., where I provide social science expertise to a range of problems. Previously, I was Senior Lecturer in the Jackson School of Global Affairs at Yale University. This website is a relic of my time in academia, and presently maintained as a research blog for work I do in my own time.
